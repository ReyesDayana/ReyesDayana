## Experience

Throughout my journey, I have gained experience in developing compilers and frameworks. Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. C++ Compiler using Bison and Flex: I developed a compiler using Bison and Flex tools for lexical and syntax analysis, respectively. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of compiler design and implementation in C++.

2.  Muster Cloud application: In this project, as a systems engineering student, I have developed a music platform utilizing JavaScript, the application incorporates data structures such as linked lists, doubly linked circular lists, stacks, queues, sparse matrix, and binary trees. The web interface includes separate views for administrators and users, featuring secure user authentication and functions for bulk data uploads. The system encompasses various sections like artist visualization, playlists, friends, blocked users, and podcasts, each represented by specific data structures. The web interface is hosted on GitHub Pages, and data input is managed in JSON format. This project showcases my skills in web development, data structure implementation, and information management, contributing to my growth as a systems engineering professional.

3. This project involves the development of the Moviecats application, a JavaScript-based web platform designed for managing and transforming the business of a Guatemalan franchise specializing in the rental of movies and video games. Moviecats, utilizes various data structures, including AVL trees, linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables, to handle movies, clients, iconic actors, and categories. The interface features views for administrators and users, providing functions such as bulk data upload, blockchain management, movie rental, rating, comments, and filtering. The project is be available [here](https://reyesdayana.github.io/EDD_Proyecto2_202002364/), and the implementation of proof of work in blockchain is a notable feature.

## Goals

As a Systems Engineering student and an aspiring software developer, I have the following goals:

1. Dive deeper into learning emerging technologies and trends in software development.
2. Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the development community.
3. Improve my problem-solving skills and algorithm design abilities.
4. Participate in hackathons and programming competitions to challenge myself and keep learning.
